# Lattice
Lattice — The Permission-First SaaS Backend  Lattice is a modular, plugin-driven backend designed for modern web SaaS apps. It gives developers a permission-first architecture out of the box, with context-aware access control, role & user permissions, and wildcard support. Spin up your backend with Fastify or Express, add plugins for Teams, Billing, Uploads, or Metrics, and let your developers focus on features instead of authorization boilerplate.  Plugin-ready: Add new features without touching the core.  Context-aware: Multi-tenant and hierarchical contexts supported.  Auditable & secure: Built-in permission registry, DB sync, and audit logs.  DX-focused: Hot-reload permissions, CLI tooling, and TypeScript support.  Think of Lattice as the Lego for SaaS backends — modular, flexible, and ready to scale.
